I'm a recent college graduate with degrees in [Computer Science] and [Brain and Cognitive Sciences], currently living in Redwood City, CA and open to exciting work opportunities.

Exciting news! My research on detecting AI-generated images is now available at [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10386096). Check it out if you're excited (or worried) about the future of AI. 

On weekends, I'm either biking up the steepest roads in the Bay Area with Alto Velo Racing Team or taking my labradoodle on long hikes.
